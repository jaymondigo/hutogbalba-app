## Dream Builder Solutions

Shelter is one of the basic needs of human. This is important yet costly when building one. Nowadays, going to different areas of suppliers, canvassing for quality, looking for architects and engineers, minding budget, are only some of the cumbersome things prior to building a house. What you envision sometimes is hard enough to find, that most of the times it would cost you too much in terms of money and effort. This is the major issue that the study has considered, an issue which is until now, remains unresolved and not provided.
We aim to develop a web-based interface for dreamers which they can maneuver to visualize their dream house and design by themselves-- seeing the structure and cost side by side. In this way, they could consider budget as well as quality.
This study aims to integrate these functionalities in a single interface. This provides framework of the basic, yet most important parts of a house, where dreamers fill with different available tools and materials. A list of suppliers to choose from is also available, with the real-time price and quality of the materials displayed, therefore helping dreamers have an estimate of the amount to be spent. This also offers contact to suppliers as well as architects and engineers when dreamers are ready to commit to the design they created. 
This IT Solution therefore makes work, canvassing and dream realization ... easier.
